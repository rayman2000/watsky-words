# Watsky Words
Watsky has released a trio of albums with overlapping names:

COM PLA INT
PLA CEM ENT
INT ENT ION

This raises the question: what other such words can we find?

# Usage
Build using ```ghc --make watsky``` and run with ```./watsky sylLength numWords fileName```, where ```sylLength``` is the number of letter per matching syllable, ```numWords``` is the number of words to find, and ```fileName``` is the name of a file which contains a list of words, one per line.
